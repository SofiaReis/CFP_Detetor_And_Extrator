Agreement Technologies refer to computer systems in which autonomous
software agents negotiate with one another, typically on behalf of
humans, in order to come to mutually acceptable agreements. An agent may
choose whether to fulfil an agreement or not, and it should fulfil it
when there is an obligation to do so derived from the standing
agreements. Autonomy, interaction, mobility and openness are key
concepts studied within the Agreement Technologies approach.

Semantic alignment, negotiation, argumentation, virtual organisations,
trust and reputation and several other technologies are part of the
sandbox to define, specify and verify such systems. The first
International Conference on Agreement Technologies is an
interdisciplinary forum that brings together researchers and
practitioners working on the various topics comprising this emergent and
vibrant field. It provides an avenue to discuss and exchange new ideas
and techniques for the design, implementation and verification of next
generation open distributed systems centred on the notion of agreement
among computational agents.

The conference is supported by COST Action IC0801 on Agreement Technologi=
es.

We encourage submission of original papers from the above-mentioned or
other related areas.

Each submission should be in one of the following categories:

Full Papers:
Papers in this category should represent original and previously
unpublished work that is currently not under review in any conference or
journal. Both basic and applied research papers are welcome. Papers
should not exceed 15 pages including references and figures.

Position Papers:
Contributions in this category may represent either a summary of
original work that has already been published in a conference or journal
(in this case submissions must include explicitly a reference to the
already published work), or a summary of original results obtained as a
product of STSMs funded by the Agreement Technologies Cost Action, or
ongoing research that can lead to important contributions to Agreement
Technologies. Submissions in this category should not exceed 2 pages.

All submissions must be written in English and formatted according to
the Springer LNCS style, which can be obtained from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Submissions must be done via easychair at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dat2012

All papers will be reviewed. The conference proceedings will be
published with CEUR-WS.org. We also plan a special issue of an ISI
ranked Journal for extended versions of high-quality papers describing
original, novel research. Further details will be announced soon.
